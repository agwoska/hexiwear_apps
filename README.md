# Hexiwear Apps

## About

This repository contains implementations for applications on the Hexiwear device.

This project was completed as undergraduate research at the
[University at Buffalo](https://buffalo.edu) being supervised by [Dr. Wenyao Xu](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/computer-science-engineering/people/faculty-directory/ladder.host.html/content/shared/engineering/computer-science-engineering/profiles/faculty/ladder/xu-wenyao.detail.html) in the Embedded Sensing and Computing Lab at the University at Buffalo, the State University of New York.

Work was completed by Andrew Woska and Sardul Saptarshi from 2021-2022.

## Description

This project focuses on rehabilitating post-stroke patients by 
slowly building up their motor skill with activities supplied by 
the Hexiwear smartwatch. 
Please see the abstract or poster for more information on
[my webpage](https://woska.net/publications) under A1.

The main application is in the folder *Hexi_App_Steady*.
This application was used at the SUNY Undergradate
Research Conference in 2022 to demonstrate the capabilities
of the watch and show that this is a viable method for motor rehabilitation.

Each application folder will contain individual documentation.

## Implementation

Mbed OS was used to create the applications for this device.

Mbed OS 5.12 must be used to prevent any issues with the
Hexiwear device. Mbed 6 does not work and earlier versions
of Mbed 5 have been deprecated.

Note that it may need to be updated as much has changed with
both Hexiwear and ARM.
